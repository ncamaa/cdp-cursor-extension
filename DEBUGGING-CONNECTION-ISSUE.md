# 🐛 Connection Issue Analysis

## What's Happening

Looking at your screenshot and curl output:

### ✅ **What's Working:**
- HTTP server is running (curl works)
- MCP server is running and capturing data (I see network logs in output)
- Chrome is launched with debugging
- Extension shows "CDP: Connected" in status bar

### ❌ **What's Not Working:**
- HTTP server shows `"connected": false`
- This means HTTP server has its own CDP connection that failed

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The issue is **architectural** - we have:
1. **MCP server process** - Has its own CDP connection (working ✅)
2. **HTTP server** - Has its own separate CDP connection (failing ❌)
3. **Extension MCP instance** - Has yet another CDP connection

**Problem**: Multiple CDP connections to the same Chrome instance can conflict.

## 💡 **Solutions**

### **Solution 1: Single CDP Connection (Recommended)**
Make HTTP server a "proxy" to the MCP server's data instead of having its own CDP connection.

### **Solution 2: Disable HTTP Server's CDP Connection**
Let MCP server handle CDP, HTTP server just serves the data from memory.

### **Solution 3: Use Only One Server**
Either MCP-only or HTTP-only, not both with separate connections.

## 🎯 **Quick Fix**

The easiest fix is to modify the HTTP server to not create its own CDP connection, since the MCP server is already capturing the data successfully.

## 🧪 **Current Status**

From your screenshot, I can see:
- ✅ MCP capturing network requests (Supabase API calls)
- ✅ MCP capturing errors ("Upload error: AxiosError")
- ✅ Chrome debugging working
- ❌ HTTP server connection status incorrect

**The debugging data is being captured correctly by MCP!** The HTTP server just needs to be fixed to show the right connection status.
