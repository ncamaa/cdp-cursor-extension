# Cursor Browser Inspector

> **🎮 NEW in v0.3.0: Browser Automation!** Cursor AI can now control the browser, test features, fill forms, click buttons, and capture screenshots. Ask Cursor to test your features and it will do it autonomously! [Learn more →](#-browser-automation-new)

**Give Cursor AI direct access to Chrome DevTools. Automatically capture console logs, network requests, and errors for 10x faster debugging.**

## 🎯 **The Problem**

Debugging with AI assistants usually requires:
1. ❌ Opening DevTools manually
2. ❌ Copying console errors
3. ❌ Copying network requests
4. ❌ Pasting everything to Cursor
5. ❌ Repeating for every issue

**This is slow, tedious, and breaks your flow.**

---

## ✨ **The Solution**

With Cursor Browser Inspector:
1. ✅ Run one command
2. ✅ Cursor automatically fetches all debugging data
3. ✅ Get instant, context-aware solutions

**Debug 10x faster with zero manual work.**

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Step 1: Install**
Install from VS Code Marketplace or download `.vsix` from [releases](https://github.com/ncamaa/cdp-cursor-extension/releases).

### **Step 2: Initialize (First time only)**
1. Open any project in Cursor
2. Click **"Initialize"** when prompted
3. Creates `.cursor/rules/cdp-debug.md` with AI instructions

### **Step 3: Connect**
Run command: **`CDP: Open Chrome With Cursor Connection`**

This automatically:
- 🌐 Launches Chrome with debugging enabled
- 🔧 Starts MCP + HTTP servers
- 🔗 Connects to Chrome DevTools Protocol
- 📊 Begins capturing all debugging data

### **Step 4: Optional - Enable MCP for Best Experience**
Run command: **`CDP: Copy MCP Configuration`**
1. Configuration copies to clipboard automatically
2. Open `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (create if doesn't exist)
3. Paste the configuration inside `"mcpServers": { }`
4. Restart Cursor

**With MCP**: Cursor uses native tools (cleaner, faster)
**Without MCP**: Cursor uses HTTP API (works great too!)

### **Step 5: Debug**
Use your app in the debug Chrome, then ask Cursor:
- "Check for console errors"
- "Show recent network requests"
- "Why is my API call failing?"
- "Test if the login button works" ← **NEW: AI can test features!**
- "Click the submit button and see what happens" ← **NEW: Browser control!**

**Cursor automatically fetches data AND can control the browser!**

## 🎬 **See It In Action**

### **Before:**
```
Developer: "My login is broken"
→ Open DevTools
→ Copy error: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'token' of undefined"
→ Paste to Cursor
→ Copy network request
→ Paste to Cursor
→ Wait for analysis...
```

### **After:**
```
Developer: "My login is broken"
→ Cursor automatically analyzes:
   • Console errors
   • API requests/responses  
   • Timing and status codes
→ Cursor: "The login fails with 401 Unauthorized, but there's also 
   a JavaScript error at login.js:45 trying to read 'token' from an 
   undefined response. The API expects 'email' but you're sending 
   'username'. Here's the fix..."
```

**From 2 minutes of manual work to instant AI-powered insights.** ⚡

## 🎮 **Usage Examples**

### **Example 1: Debugging Login Errors**
```
You: "My login button isn't working"

Cursor (automatically fetches):
  • Console errors
  • Login API requests/responses

Cursor: "The login request returns 401 Unauthorized. 
You're sending 'username' but the API expects 'email'. 
Also, there's a JavaScript error trying to access 
response.data.token when response.data is undefined."
```

### **Example 2: Performance Issues**
```
You: "The dashboard is slow to load"

Cursor (automatically analyzes):
  • Network request timing
  • Slow API calls
  • Large response sizes

Cursor: "The /api/dashboard endpoint takes 3.2 seconds 
and returns 120MB. You should add pagination and only 
fetch visible data."
```

### **Example 3: CORS Problems**
```
You: "Getting CORS errors"

Cursor (automatically identifies):
  • CORS error in console
  • Blocked requests
  • Missing headers

Cursor: "Your request to https://api.external.com is 
blocked by CORS. The response is missing 
'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header. Add your origin 
to the server's CORS configuration."
```

### **Example 4: Self-Testing Features (NEW!)** 🎮
```
You: "Test if the login form I just created works"

Cursor (automatically tests):
  1. Gets page HTML to find form elements
  2. Fills email field via JavaScript
  3. Fills password field via JavaScript
  4. Clicks login button
  5. Waits and checks console for errors
  6. Checks network for API call
  7. Captures screenshot of result
  8. Analyzes everything

Cursor: "✅ Login works! Form submitted successfully, 
API returned 200 OK, user redirected to /dashboard. 
No console errors. Screenshot shows success message."
```

## 🎨 **Status Bar Integration**

Visual indicator in the bottom-right corner:

- `🔴 CDP: Off` - Not connected (click to start)
- `🟢 CDP: Connected` - Active connection (click to stop)

---

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Connection fails**
- Ensure Chrome launches successfully
- Check Output panel: View > Output > "CDP Debug Server"
- Verify ports 3100 and 9222 are available

### **No data captured**
- Use the Chrome window launched by the extension
- Refresh your webpage after connecting
- Ensure you're on an actual webpage (not chrome:// URL)

### **MCP tools not available**
- MCP requires Cursor restart after first configuration
- HTTP API works immediately as fallback
- Both methods provide the same debugging data
